In recent years, the extensive use of machine learning and neural networks has made it possible for computers to intelligently process images. In our research work, we attempt to use the generative adversarial networks principle to process pictures and videos to realize the automatic rendering of old films and pictures. Our system basically realizes the re-color rendering of black and white video frames, and the rendering results are more reasonable, furthermore, the color configuration confirms to people's normal aesthetic standard.
